<p>The phrase “Conquest of Cancer”,
though perhaps emotive rather than
scientific, nevertheless implies the
existence of a very real and important
problem. And this problem, it may be
confidently affirmed, is one that will
never be solved, in action, by the efforts
of the medical profession <em>alone</em>. Whatever
be the future, and as yet reserved,
revelations of Science, and whatever
the further developments of Art, cancer
will not cease to exact its toll unless
medical science and art obtain the
intelligent co-operation of an instructed
public. It is for this reason that it has
been thought useful to place before the
public this little book, written by a
practical surgeon who has given special
attention to the problems of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
laboratory. The book itself, which not
only states in simple language the
essential points that should be comprehended
by the public, but puts
forward a plan for concerted action, is
based upon one of a series of University
Extension lectures given during
the winter of 1922–23, at the Shantung
Christian University, Tsinan, China,
where Mr Wright is actively engaged
in the Surgical Department of the
School of Medicine.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The task of prefacing this essay by
some words of introduction has devolved
upon the present writer, not because he
either has, or desires to present, any
claim to speak with special authority
concerning Cancer, but by reason of a
close personal and professional friendship
that has led him to appreciate very
warmly the knowledge, the sincerity,
and the disinterestedness that characterize
Mr Wright’s thought and work.
And he is confident that we may accept
what has been said about Cancer at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Shantung as an honest and candid
attempt to instruct and to construct,
in detachment from the pribbles and
prabbles that have sometimes confused
discussion nearer home.</p>

<p>Now, although the public has the
undoubted right to demand information
on this subject, and although, as has
been suggested, without admission of
the public to the arena of discussion
little can be done to diminish the
present mortality from Cancer, yet is
there real difficulty in communicating
knowledge, without engendering unnecessary
fear and alarm and sending
the hypochondriac to those quacks and
charlatans who diagnose non-existent
disease in order that they may reap
reward by announcing its cure.</p>

<p>Some weaker minds there will always
be: so, whenever attention is directed
towards some public danger, there are
those who adopt the possible contingency
as a peg on which to hang some
ragged vestment of distracted emotion
or thought. Thirty years ago, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
insane feared the telephone: during
the Boer War, many thought that the
“scouts were after them”; now-a-days
lunatics babble of persecution by wireless,
by Bolsheviks, or even by psycho-analysts.
So, in Victorian times, the
<i lang="fr">malades imaginaires</i> who then thronged
consulting rooms spoke with bated
breath of Bright’s disease: to-day, the
hysterical secretly hope to hear the
blessed word “Colitis”, and the hypochondriac
as secretly dread the verdict
of “Cancer”!</p>

<p>The task of the medical profession is
to enlighten the laymen, that their help
may be enlisted, and yet to avoid alike
exaggeration and smooth sayings, false
hopes and false fears. Macaulay, in a
familiar passage, once said that there is
nothing more ridiculous than the
British public in one of its periodical
fits of morality. At present, the
British Public is less concerned than
formerly with questions of morality,
but is very much concerned with
questions of health. Perhaps it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
so much health that is sought and
desired as absence of pain and avoidance
of death—which is not quite the same
thing. But, though there is nothing
intrinsically ridiculous in seeking the
“advancement of morality” or the
“conquest of disease”, the one, no less
than the other, may be pursued in a
ridiculous and dangerous manner.</p>

<p>The adoption of ill-conceived
measures, designed to improve morals
or to abolish disease, may, and often
does entail consequences that are even
less desirable than the evils it is hoped
to combat. While the prohibition of
the consumption or sale of alcoholic
drinks may diminish certain ills, it has
yet to be shewn that the casting out of
devils in the name of Beelzebub may
not be followed by possession with
others yet more violent. A few years
ago we were adjured to boil all milk,
lest we became poisoned by certain
microbes: we are now told that, if all
milk be boiled, we are as if deprived of
vitamines, and must suffer accordingly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Instances might be multiplied; but it
should be obvious that moral and
physical health must be considered, not
as physical objects, but as relations,
or states of equilibrium. Like all states
of adjustment or equilibrium, they are
the result of accommodation: of poise
and counterpoise. They are not always
and everywhere to be secured by the
throwing of a certain weight into one
or other scalepan, or by the cutting-off
so many inches from the table-leg that
seems the longest. So much, at least,
should be recognised by a seriously
disturbed public told by the daily
press that so many more people than
formerly now die of cancer; that
science has not yet discovered the
“cause of cancer”; but that all may
be well if only we live on Nebuchadnezzar
food washed down by paraffin.</p>

<p>Mr Wright’s essay, combining as it
does a well-balanced and sufficient
statement of what is known, with the
outline of a constructive proposition
that merits careful consideration, and at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
least indicates to the public the kind
of way in which relative safety may be
obtained under present conditions,
seems one that is eminently suitable
for what may be called general reading.
The problem is fairly and lucidly
presented: the resources of surgery are
quietly and reasonably demonstrated:
and the advantages are shown of
exhibiting that kind of prudence which
leads the business man to seek auditing
of his accounts and the sportsman to
enquire how his score stands. But
some words may perhaps be added
from the standpoint of one who is a
physician, and no surgeon.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Cancer is a class name given to certain
kinds of growths, otherwise spoken of
as tumours (or swellings) and ulcers,
which are, as we say, characterised by
malignancy. A growth, tumour, or
ulcer which is <em>not</em> malignant is <em>not</em>
called a cancer. By malignancy we
mean a tendency to spread, by local
and direct extension (as spreads a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
fire), or by convection, as when
sparks fly from a locomotive to a
haystack. Malignant tumours or ulcers
tend to recur when removed, and, in
the long run, to destroy life.</p>

<p>These general features are associated
with certain microscopical characters
found in the tumours or ulcers, so that
the nature of any growth—whether
malignant or otherwise—can be sometimes
determined by the surgeon or
physician, and sometimes by the pathologist
or microscopist alone, but, as
a rule, is most certainly settled by the
physician or surgeon acting in conjunction
with the microscopist. Yet,
and this is important, not every cancer
does actually destroy life. Surgeons of
the greatest experience, such as the
late Sir Alfred Pearce-Gould, have
affirmed that undoubted cancers do
occasionally undergo spontaneous cure,
or at least arrest of growth, <em>even in the
absence of any treatment</em>. Again, if
excision is practised early, and sufficiently
extensively, recurrence does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
not happen, in a certain proportion of
cases. Finally, pain is no necessary or
inevitable concomitant of cancer. In
many cases pain is absent, or almost
so; death may be due to mechanical
consequences entailed by the growth
rather than to destruction of any vital
or sensitive part.</p>

<p>Now, medical men are in the habit
of splitting up the group or class of
malignant growths (or “cancers”) into
two subsidiary groups or classes. One
of these is named Sarcoma; the other
Carcinoma. Sarcoma is the name given
to a group of malignant growths
taking origin in the structures and
tissues developed from the “middle
layer” of the embryo: the growths
themselves—sarcomata—partake the
nature of the tissues formed from this
middle layer. The other group, of
carcinomata, consists of growths taking
origin in, and partaking the nature
of one or other of the two remaining
embryonic layers and the structures
developed from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>These two layers form respectively:</p>

<p class="hang">(1)&#160;The skin and related structures,
and</p>

<p class="hang">(2)&#160;The lining of the tube passing
through the body; its backwaters,
out-growths and
appendages.</p>

<p>It is these two layers which, as Mr
Wright so aptly remarks, are in direct
contact with the outer world. Now,
while the carcinomata (which constitute
the class of cancers chiefly discussed in
this book) in general affect people who
have passed the midpoint of life—those
for whom, as Rabelais says, it is <i lang="fr">midi
passé</i>—the sarcomata, which are less
common than the carcinomata, are
rather more frequently, yet not exclusively,
found in young people; in
those indeed, who have not reached
life’s apogee. It is important that these
facts should be borne in mind, for
generalisations founded upon the study
of carcinomata alone cannot be
necessarily true in respect of all Cancer,
unless the use of the term cancer <em>be</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
<em>restricted</em> to the class technically known
as carcinoma. To say that Cancer can
be prevented if constipation is avoided
is clearly misleading, when we remember
that quite young children, nay,
infants, may be the subject of sarcoma;
unless of course we define cancer, as
some would do, as the kind of growth
that, <i lang="la">ex hypothesi</i>, is prevented when
constipation is avoided. It is confusion
of this sort, bred by slovenly expression
out of loose thinking, that is in great
part responsible for the present
bewilderment of the public.</p>

<p>Another fertile source of confusion
is the obscurity that attends both the
popular and the professional use of
the words “cause”, “causation”, and
the like. The public demands that
“the” cause of cancer be discovered,
and is prepared to pay generously that
this discovery be made. Unfortunately
neither the public, nor men of science,
care overmuch to discuss what they
mean by cause and causation. This is
no place in which to trench upon a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
province unsuccessfully explored by
Locke, by Hume, and by Kant. Yet
it is of vital importance that all doctors,
scientists, and laymen should recognise
two different <em>uses</em> of these words.</p>

<p>When we speak about “the” cause
of a “disease”, in a generalised or
conceptual sense, as when we say that
Koch’s bacillus is “the cause of
tuberculosis”, we are really defining
our concept of the disease in terms of
<em>one</em> correlative. We are saying that
tuberculosis is a disease in which Koch’s
bacillus is invariably present. A <i lang="la">circulus
in definiendo</i> is only just escaped
because we happen to know that, if
Koch’s bacillus is injected into certain
animals, the “disease” as we say,
develops. Koch’s bacillus is the one
constant correlative found in all cases
of the kind that we agree to call tuberculous,
by reason of certain clinical and
pathological signs that we find. Possibly
even this statement is not to be taken
as absolutely true; though it represents
what we find it convenient to say. But,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
when we thus declare Koch’s bacillus
to be “the” cause of tuberculosis, we
have by no means exhausted the study
of all the correlations that may be
called causal in respect of <em>particular</em>
cases. Of ten cases of tuberculosis,
each one exhibiting Koch’s bacillus,
we may say that <em>for each particular
case</em> “the” cause of the illness is
different.</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<p class="hang">A.&#160;&#160;is tuberculous because he was
gassed in France;</p>

<p class="hang">B.&#160;&#160;is tuberculous because he was
infected by his sick wife;</p>

<p class="hang">C.&#160;&#160;is tuberculous because he drank
tuberculous milk;</p>

<p class="hang">D.&#160;&#160;is tuberculous because he worked
in an ill-ventilated factory;</p>

<p class="hang">E.&#160;&#160;because he was exposed to wet
and cold; and</p>

<p class="hang">F.&#160;&#160;because he drank and was dirty.</p>

<p>The difference between a medical
cause in the generalised sense, (where
cause means a defining correlative for a
concept), and a medical cause in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
particular sense (when we seek to find
out or state the antecedent without
which this man would not be as he is
here and now) is one of enormous
importance, and one that should be
constantly borne in mind when discussion
is commenced. It is true that
it involves the oldest of logical and
metaphysical problems in respect of
scientific thought—the question of
universals and particulars; but that
does not make it any the more easily
shirked. Its relevance to the question
of cancer is this: that the proof of the
production of cancer in men or in
animals <em>under one set of circumstances</em>
does not warrant us in saying that that
set of circumstances <em>as known to us</em>
involves <em>all</em> the factors without which
cancer cannot occur. And, even if
research work demonstrated that, in
every case now called cancer, some
parasite or growth-form, some irritating
factor that can be isolated, does actually
obtain, <em>unless it could be shewn that this
parasite or factor is never found except</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
<em>where there is cancer as we now define it</em>,
we should have to proceed to investigate
why and how cancer does not
always occur when this factor is present.
Just so are we at present seeking to
explain why and how, of so many
persons exposed to infection by Koch’s
bacillus, only certain ones do become
diseased. If we find that only those
persons who possess a character that
we may call “X” become infected, we
shall then have to say that, not Koch’s
bacillus, but the character “X” is
“the” cause of tuberculosis. It is
thus that science progresses: not by
making the absolute and positive discoveries
that the public is taught to
expect, but by arranging and rearranging
our experiential knowledge,
as such grows, in terms of so-called laws
and generalisations, that are found
<em>progressively convenient</em>. But such laws
and generalisations are not necessarily
the one more “true” than the other,
<em>except in relation to the knowledge that
they summarize</em>. If such considerations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
as these were more frequently borne in
mind, there would be less unconscious
deception, less disappointment, and
greater economy in work and thought.</p>

<p>Explanations of the causation of
cancer have been sought in many
directions; and three chief theories
have been set out. The most important,
and the most interesting from the
point of view of the practising physician,
is that which considers cancer as provoked
by long continued irritation
under certain circumstances. This
doctrine seems more “true” in respect
of the Carcinomata—the cancers of
the adult and the old, and of tissues in
contact with the extra-personal world—than
it is in respect of the Sarcomata—the
cancers of the young, and of those
inner parts not exposed to irritation by
contact with the world. Yet sarcomata
in real life do often seem to follow
<em>injury</em>, and the tissues in which they
form <em>may</em> be obnoxious to injurious
influences of which we know nothing.</p>

<p>Another view is that cancer may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
due to a parasite of some kind or
another. Certainly, so far as some
lower animals are concerned, this is
true, for certain rat and mice cancers
are now known definitely to be
associated with parasites. But then
we may say, and properly, that in such
cases the parasites are merely acting
as do other irritants, and are not
“specific” causes of cancer.</p>

<p>The third doctrine, or set of doctrines,
regards cancers as arising when parts
of the body (or rather, elements in the
tissues of certain parts) no longer act
in due subordination to the needs of
the whole organism, but comport themselves
“anti-socially”: developing
irregularly; propagating themselves
illegitimately; and so becoming parasitic
to the commonwealth of the body.
Those who hold this will admit that,
in many cases, this revolutionary
tendency is one provoked by irritation
and the like: that sometimes it is a
mere manifestation of irregular decay;
and that, when it occurs in young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
subjects, it is because some islets of
tissue have become misplaced, tucked
away, ill-formed, and hampered in
development, and so liable to provoke
trouble later under stress of greater or
less urgency. Such a view has much
plausibility; there are flaws in a steel
girder; there are tucked-in edges in
even the best bound book, and there
are developmental errors in most of us.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is Dr Creighton’s
doctrine of physiological resistance.
A part not put to its proper use is more
apt than another to become cancerous.
Certainly, unmarried women are more
liable than are married to suffer cancer
of the breast or ovary. Yet married
women are more apt than unmarried
to suffer cancer of the womb. Are we
to say that in these latter there has
been physiological misuse, or irritation
produced by unhealthy child-bearing?
So far is the problem removed from
simplicity!</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is certainly as
true as ever, that the gods still cancel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
a sense misused, and, if we leave out
of account for the moment the cases
in which cancer seems due to developmental
error—and who can say whether
even then a child does not suffer
vicariously for some physiological
transgression by its parents?—the
doctrine that cancer is due to irritation,
whether produced by a clay pipe, hot
drinks, constipation, or crude paraffin,
does not really tell us much more than
<em>that</em>. The difficulty is this: <em>How</em> to
walk in the way of physiological
righteousness, and <em>how</em> to preach it,
without falling into a dogmatism as
stupid as unbelief? Mr Wright tells
us how, in medieval times, the Church
declared cancer of the tongue to be
sometimes a judgment on sinners for
their blasphemy. Well, I for one, am
not prepared to limit the “misuse”
that entails physical disease and suffering
to misuse in the material, or
physiological sense. Organs, through
the nerves of the “sympathetic”, are
directly connected with the play of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
emotions and of feeling-states. I am
not sure that investigation would not
shew a correlation—sometimes—between
certain persistent and voluntary
mental states (<em>morbid</em> mental states,
that is) and the development of cancer
in certain organs. The “argument”
that cancer is infrequent in lunatic
asylums, where the majority are mindless
rather than wrongly thoughtful,
evades the question.</p>

<p>The quest for a single causal factor,
whose “discovery” will lead us to
“abolish cancer”, is then, it would
seem, just one more hunt for the
philosopher’s stone. Yet, to use the
formula of “right living” does not
seem to be merely a verbal solution
of the difficulty.</p>

<p>If we agree that to live rightly is the
best insurance we can make against
cancer, we are probably stating, as
compendiously as possible, <em>all</em> we do
and shall ever know, in respect of the
causation of cancer. It is then our
duty to ascertain how to live rightly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
in every sense of the word, and we may
so come to realise that almost every
one of what we call the blessings of
civilisation has been purchased at the
expense, in some respect, of right living.
For this, heavy interest has to be
paid, and even the efforts of science to
put matters right seem too often not
more than the borrowing of fresh
capital to pay off old debts. It is right
to call attention to the fact that
certain “uncivilised” races, who live
healthily and naturally in respect of
food, drink, and sexual activity, do not
suffer from cancer. But it is wrong to
suggest that therefore we should adopt
either their dietetic or their sexual
customs. What is one man’s meat is
another man’s poison. Adjustment to our
surroundings, right living <em>here and now</em> is
what we need. Though Papuans and
Sikhs may be very properly adjusted in
<em>their</em> contexts, it is not their adjustments
that may best suit our cases.</p>

<p>This problem—that of right living—is
the problem of prevention of cancer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
put upon the broadest basis. But,
until or unless we work this out, we
have to consider how best to avail
ourselves of the knowledge already in
our possession. Herein is one merit of
Mr Wright’s plan. He tells people
what, in his judgment, they can best
do, <em>here and now</em>. It is a plan to be
discussed; but, let it be clearly understood,
it is one submitted by the author
for individual consideration and action.
Supposing it to be found, on analysis
and trial, of real value, a cry might at
once be raised for its putting into
execution by central or local provision
of the necessary facilities: at first for
voluntary acceptance, then for compulsory
adoption. Nothing could be
a greater error. In matters of health
what is advantageous for the individual
is often not so, or even grossly disadvantageous,
for the State.</p>

<p>Let every member of the State have
the opportunity to avail himself or
herself of what Science and Art can do
for him: let none who has the will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
suffer because he has not the means.
But the too easy provision of means for
the avoidance of consequences of neglect
does, very seriously, put a premium
on neglect and penalise those who themselves
make effort in the right direction.
Again: hard on individuals though it
would seem, there is a very real racial
advantage in the elimination—natural
and inevitable, unless we interfere—of
those who <em>will not</em> take advantage of
opportunities offered them. We are
not automata: we exercise <em>choice</em>;
when the opportunity of choosing
rightly is offered us, if then we choose
wrongly, we have no right to demand
escape from the consequences, <em>at the
expense of others</em>.</p>

<p>At any rate, if the facts relating to
Cancer are plainly stated, every man
has but himself to blame if he shrink
from obtaining such diagnosis and
treatment, as is now available, at the
earliest moment. It were better still
that he avoid from the beginning all
what we know to be predisposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
causes of cancer: all the errors of
omission and commission in respect of
the physiological and spiritual—or
physical and psychical—functions and
relations of his Self.</p>

<p>It is the principle, the pursuit of
the unattainable ideal, that really
counts. The simple injunction to eat
greens and take paraffin is the physiological
counterpart of seeking to make
people moral by act of Parliament,
religious by church-going, and intelligent
by attendance at evening lectures.
But even if we make all possible
effort, we cannot <em>all</em> hope to escape,
and the necessity for seeking early
diagnosis when things go not well is
as imperative as is true the maxim that
“A stitch in time saves nine”.</p>

<p>There is perhaps one more question
that may be touched upon: that of the
so-called <em>increase</em> of cancer. It is
commonly stated that cancer is increasing:
it is as commonly asked if
this is really so. As a matter of fact,
the question (which we are usually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
told can be only answered by statisticians)
is one that statisticians can only
answer when we have agreed what they
are to understand by it. And that is
not so easy as may be at first thought.</p>

<p>It is certainly true that, in the British
Isles, the number of deaths certified
each year as due to cancer of one form
or another is gradually and steadily
increasing, both absolutely and
relatively to the population. But then
we have in the first place, to consider
whether cancer is not diagnosed more
frequently in ratio to the cases seen than
was formerly the case, and, in the second,
to remember that cancer is, on the
whole, a disease suffered during the
second half of life. Now, our population
is an older one than it was: the
birth-rate is falling: so many youths
who would now be vigorous men of
thirty-five to forty lost their lives in
the war; and lives are, on the whole,
longer than they were, owing to a
diminishing liability to suffer from certain
ailments other than Cancer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>Supposing that children ceased to be
born, at the same time that the Ministry
of Health succeeded in “abolishing”
all diseases except cancer, and the Home
Office and Police reduced the probability
of death from accident, from
homicide, and from suicide, to vanishing
point. Would we not then all die from
either “old age” or from “cancer”?
If so; should we be justified in declaring
that cancer had “enormously increased”
since the successful institution
of control of our own deaths and
other peoples’ births?</p>

<p>We are, indeed, again confronted
with the old problem of the one and the
many, under one of its numberless
aspects. From the point of view of the
statistical bureaucrat, cancer is increasing.
That is to say, an increasing
number of deaths, and an increasing
proportion of deaths, are every year
presented to him, both absolutely and
in relation to the population. And so
many more perforated cards are in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
consequence manipulated by his
counting machine.</p>

<p>Can it be said that, for any one
reader of these pages, the chances of
death from cancer are year by year
increasing, as are the chances of being
run over in the London streets? Who
can say?</p>

<p>But this is true. We must all die.
We are, for the most part, anxious to
postpone the day of death, and many of
us dread, more than aught else, a death
from cancer.</p>

<p>Effort in the path of right living—if
steadily pursued—and the intelligent
utilization of what Science and Art
and Experience have to teach, will
undoubtedly make for healthier and
longer lived communities, and will
lessen, <em>for each individual</em>, the probability
of dying otherwise than in the
fashion thought of by the doctor when
he ascribes death to “old age”. The
problem we are considering becomes
indeed swallowed up by a still greater
one; but, those who profit by what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Mr Wright has had to say about
Cancer, will profit in respect of this
greater problem as well. Therein, so
it seems, lies its greatest value.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CONQUEST">THE CONQUEST OF CANCER</h2>
</div>


<p>The cure of cancer is now ceasing to
become a purely medical problem, to be
solved by biologists, pathologists and
surgeons, and is becoming a problem in
psychology, and education, to be solved
by publicists, schoolmasters, and perhaps,
when enough people are alive
to the facts of the situation, by
legislators and statesmen.</p>

<p>This may sound a bold thing to say,
but I hope to be able to bring forward
evidence proving that it is at present
possible to cure seventy-five per cent.
of cancer cases with a mortality of
under five per cent.</p>

<p>Possibly the response to this essay
will be that of one of the most enlightened
persons of my acquaintance
who, on seeing my title, said, “Of
course this is perfectly absurd”, but
it was a favourite saying of Dr Maguire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
a great American surgeon of the nineteenth
century, that the most useful
thing one man can do for his fellows is
to see a thing clearly, and to say it
plainly.</p>

<p>Here is a plain statement, susceptible
of the fullest proof. Out of every
hundred people in our community, ten
will in all probability die of cancer;
and, of those ten, seven or eight could
be cured, or their disease prevented
with the present methods at our disposal.
All that is required is an
intelligent facing of the facts concerning
this disease, and efficient medical
attention.</p>

<p>The average annual deaths during
the last eleven years in the United
Kingdom were 466,000,—nearly half
a million people. Of these, 43,000 were
due to cancer; 19,000 males and
24,000 females. Moreover, although
taken altogether ten per cent. of the
population die of cancer, a
greater proportion of adults so die.
I say again that a large proportion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
these cases is either preventable or
curable.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee of the
British Empire Cancer Campaign have
recently published a statement based
on the last census. They say that,
during the year 1921, in Great Britain,
of persons over 30 years of age, one out
of every seven died of cancer.</p>

<p>These figures make it plain that the
question is not merely one of interest
to doctors and scientists; it is of
concern to every one of us, and to one
person in every ten it has direct and
very personal interest.</p>

<p>Surgery and medicine have very
little further to advance along technical
lines, so far as the type of case we see
at present is concerned. It is nearly
impossible to make operations more
extensive and thorough than they
are at present; and it is unlikely that
the operative mortality in the average
good risk will fall much lower than its
present very small figure. Other
methods of curing cancer do not at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
moment show promise of producing
anything so good as the present surgical
results. We have therefore to resort
to an educational campaign for its victims
before we can get much further on.</p>

<p>This brings me to the first point to
be brought home before any more is
said—that <em>early</em> cancer and <em>late</em> cancer
are, so far as results and cures are
concerned, two entirely different
diseases. A well-known English
authority, speaking of cancer of the
tongue, says: “An early superficial
cancer on the free part of the tongue
should be, and is, curable in practically
all cases. The general conviction of
the incurability of cancer is founded on
the results of operation on the average
fairly advanced case and, until this
conviction is shaken, I fear the public
will remain relatively indifferent and
pessimistic as to the advantages of
early treatment. Every surgeon of any
experience is aware that, as regards its
accessibility to treatment, early cancer
is a totally different disease from even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
moderately advanced cancer, but I am
very doubtful as to whether we shall
be able to enforce the fact by direct
statement so long as the treatment of
advanced cases furnishes the public
with so many terrible object lessons in
the apparent intractability of the
disease.”</p>

<p>The problem we have before us, then,
is that of changing the whole attitude,
not only of the physician, but of the
patient, to cancer. Here is an example
of the present point of view:—I have
frequently heard it said that such and
such a patient has a lump, or some
disquieting symptom or other, but she
won’t go to the doctor as she is afraid
he will say it is cancer. What we have
to do is to strip this disease of its fear-complex
and bring all the facts about it
into the open. We have to change the
attitude of the patient, and often,
unfortunately, of his doctor, from one
of “wait and see” to one of “look and
see.” Then, and only then, shall we
be on the way to curing cancer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>The results of the present-day and
popular point of view are appalling.
Somewhere about half the cases of
cancer are far too advanced for us to
think about curing them at the time
the patients appear. Of the remaining
half, approximately two-thirds have
about a thirty per cent. chance of cure,
and the remainder about a sixty per
cent. chance. These figures are rough
estimates based on impressions formed
in hospital out-patient work, but they
will not be found far wrong. The heart-breaking
part of it is that it is all the
result of fear, carelessness and crooked
thinking, which could be avoided in
a large percentage of the cases.</p>

<p>Yet there are signs that we are
entering on a new phase, and that a
realisation of the importance of early
diagnosis is slowly permeating through
the medical profession. In America
we see an increasing insistence on the
use of detailed and specialised laboratory
methods for exact diagnosis; and
in Great Britain there is in existence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
at St. Andrew’s University, a complete
medical unit, under the supervision of
Sir James Mackenzie, for the investigation
of the early symptoms of disease.
The establishment of this institute is,
I think, one of the most important
advances that medicine has made in
the last twenty-five years, for it is a
milestone on the road to progress, a
concrete and tangible expression of a
changed point of view.</p>

<p>Let us for the moment leave generalities
and give some few minutes to
more detailed consideration of the
disease; first in outline, and then in
respect of some particular cases.</p>

<p>Cancer is a degeneration. It most
often occurs at that period of life when
our biological work is done, and, as far
as Nature is concerned, we are of no
use. From <em>her</em> point of view we are on
this planet to reproduce our kind and,
when we are past doing that, our tissues
begin to lose their firm hold on their
appointed form, and stray from their
former habit of exactly reproducing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
<em>their</em> kind when attempting to recover
from any kind of injury. Cancer is
commonest in those organs which have
soonest finished their work—the reproductive
organs of women; and,
after these, it appears most often in
that organ so much more abused than
any other—the stomach.</p>

<p>The greatest number of cases appears
at or after fifty, and therefore at that
age it behoves us, not to <em>wait and see</em>
whether we shall get it or not, but to
<em>look and see</em> that we have not got it,
for of people who survive till the age
of fifty, a great many more than ten
per cent. die of cancer.</p>

<p>From the biological point of view
cancer presents another interesting
feature. It used to be generally stated
by biologists that acquired characteristics
cannot be transmitted. In cancer
we see a cell taking on foreign characteristics
in response to some environmental
stimulus and transmitting these
to its offspring until the organism from
which it sprang is destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>To sum up, the tissues from which
cancer grows, in their normal process
of repair tend to reproduce themselves
more or less exactly, or if the injury
is too gross, they are replaced by scar
tissue; but when we reach the age at
which their biological work is done,
there is a tendency to atypical reproduction,
in which an atypical cell
continues to reproduce itself atypically
and grows at the expense of the organism,
eating into or eroding it as it
enlarges, till it finally kills the host
on which it preys.</p>

<p>This will serve as a general definition,
but, if we wish to be a little more
concrete, we must plunge for a while
into the realms of pathology, in order
to get a clearer idea of what cancer
means.</p>

<p>Our body is made up of three layers
of tissues; each of these has its
separate function, and, within small
limits, its own way of reacting to long
continued injury. Early in our prenatal
development, these three layers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
can be distinguished, and each of these
later produces its own type of tissue,
and under appropriate conditions, its
own type of malignant tumour. From
the outer and inner layers develop the
cells which actually touch the outside
world, that is to say, which cover
the exterior of our body and provide
our inner lining, or mucous membranes.
From the inner layer is developed
glands which are, so to speak, ingrowths
from this layer, and it is the tumours
arising from this latter tissue layer
which mostly concern us now, and which
are the cause of so much human
suffering.</p>

<p>These Carcinomata, as they are called,
all have something in common, alike
from the point of view of their recognition,
pathology and onset. They
begin in some tissue which has
previously been the seat of disease,
usually some chronic inflammatory
process which has been present for
years, and which may have healed up
and broken down many times. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
this occurs on open surfaces, such as
the tongue, intestinal mucous membrane,
or lip, we can watch the gradual
transformation of the disease from a
simple chronic inflammatory process
to that of a malignant growth.</p>

<p>Let us take, for instance, the case of
cancer of the lip. We see an old man
who for years has been smoking a clay
pipe. The stem of the pipe gets shorter
as the years go by, and consequently,
as he smokes it, hotter and hotter.
One day he notices that his lip is cracked,
the crack being just on that part with
which he habitually holds his pipe. If
we were to look at this under the
microscope we should just see that the
mucous membrane was broken at this
point. Perhaps he stops smoking for
a day or two till his lip has healed, and
then continues to smoke again. Soon,
from force of habit, the pipe returns to
its old comfortable spot; and again the
lip cracks. This time it is not so
painful, and takes longer to heal. This
cracked lip may be present for years,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
and if, after some time, we were to look
at it again under the microscope, we
should see a very different kind of thing.
All round the crack would be congregated
thousands of white blood cells,
trying vainly to assist the sore to heal,
but, as well as this, we should notice
that, in their efforts to bridge the gap
of broken mucous membrane, the
delicate epithelial cells which line our
lips had increased in number and
thickness. We might also see that
they had a tendency to grow down to
the deeper layers of the lip.</p>

<p>If we were to persuade our friend to
give up his clay pipe and indulge in
some other form of smoking, or even
to have a few teeth extracted so that
his pipe was more comfortable in some
other position, the small ulcer would,
given time and a little attention, heal
up quite satisfactorily. But, with all
the perversity of human nature, he will
not; he only has a small sore: it
doesn’t hurt him, or anyone else, so
why should he worry?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>We pass on another few years, and
our friend reappears. This time his
sore has a more permanent appearance
about it. It is hard, and somehow
looks as if it goes deep, and has a
tendency to bleed. We look at it and
tell him that he ought to let us cut out
that small sore, but as a rule he won’t
allow this procedure; he wants medicine
to take for it, an ointment to put
on it. If we were again to have a
microscopical section at our disposal
we should see a very different state of
things. Those epithelial cells which
before were just thickened, and a little
angry looking, have at last wakened up
and begun to grow. They have
branched out and grown deeper into
the lip; there is nothing to check them
since they have thrown aside all the
restraints imposed by the necessity of
keeping to their original form, and
have, so to speak, got out of the control
of the usual mechanisms which the
body possesses for keeping cells in their
proper place. The only thing we can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
do for the patient is either to find some
means to kill them—an end which has
not yet been achieved, as what will kill
them will also kill the patient—or to
cut away the tissue in which they have
grown, leaving a wide margin around
the farthest palpable edge of the ulcer.
If this is done, the patient can be
assured of a permanent cure. But if
he will not believe you, as he often will
not, possibly because you are not
willing to stake your reputation on the
ulcer being malignant, or the <em>certainty</em>
of its cure by surgery, he will go away
for another year or so. One day he
appears again because his ulcer has
been showing a tendency to bleed and
has got a bit bigger lately; also he has
noticed, while shaving, a small hard
lump in his neck which he feels as the
razor goes over it. He still has no pain
and no discomfort whatever. We look
at this and tell him that he has to
undergo an operation, both on his lip
and on his neck, and that he has got
cancer. We remove the ulcer and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
every gland that we can find in a large
area around, but we can only assure
him that he has a one in five or three
chance of a permanent cure whereas,
if he had taken our previous advice,
we could have promised him a permanent
cure in between ninety and
one hundred per cent. of chances,
according to the age of the disease.</p>

<p>If we now use our microscope, we see
that the undisciplined epithelial cells
have penetrated the lymphatic capillaries
which are present in all our tissues,
and have followed them until they
reach their destination, the nearest
glands. What will happen next depends
on time. The growth may spread to
more glands, or even outside the glands,
and the only course we have open to us
is to remove the primary growth,
again with a wide margin, irrespective
of what disfigurement may result,
together with its corresponding lymphatic
glands, trusting to radium or
X-rays to kill any stray cells that
may be set free or missed during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
operation. The chances of cure simply
depend on whether it is possible to
remove the disease completely or not.</p>

<p>The figures I have given are taken
from a recent analysis of more than
five hundred cases of cancer of the lip
carefully followed up. Of cases in
which there were no glands involved,
ninety-one per cent. were cured: of
those with glands only eighteen per
cent. were cured. Now here is the
point I want to emphasize. The
average duration of all these cases was
two and a half years before operation.
It is impossible to devise any more
radical operation, with a much lower
death-rate than we at present obtain,
and there is no other method which as
yet produces better results than I have
just quoted, but it <em>is</em> possible to do
away with that two and a half years
of waiting and medicine. There is no
reason for it but ignorance, neglect,
stupidity, self-deception and fear.</p>

<p>The example which I have just
quoted is not an unusual one, nor, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
I hope to show you later on, do the
figures materially differ for cancer
arising in other parts of the body.
Cancer of the lip merely happens to be
a convenient, and easily understood,
peg upon which to hang my text.</p>

<p>Cancer is practically always preceded
by chronic irritation of some kind or
other. There may be, and in fact are,
other factors which enter into the
problem, but there can be no doubt
that in nearly all cases there is what
may be called a precancerous stage,
which, if adequately dealt with, will
often prevent cancer appearing at all.
It is moreover a longstanding chronic
condition which, as a rule, gives rise
to very little inconvenience on the part
of the patient.</p>

<p>After this <em>precancerous</em> stage there
appears what may be called <em>early cancer</em>,
often indistinguishable to the naked
eye from the original precancerous
lesion, but giving rise to great suspicion
in the eyes of the initiated on account
of its hardness, and tendency to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
fixed, and its resistance to treatment.
Cancer in this stage can be cured, with
results which will compare favourably
with the cure of any other known
disease (i.e., in about ninety per cent.
of all cases) its cure simply depending
on early diagnosis. This is a fact
neither known nor appreciated by the
general public, and until it is known by
everybody, and these early stages are
radically dealt with, we shall still be
spending our time and money looking
for new and miraculous cures for a
condition which, in its very nature, is
unlikely to be susceptible to any method
of cure when its late stages are reached.</p>

<p>The third stage is that in which the
neighbouring lymph glands are involved.
In this stage about thirty per cent. are
incurable, but these figures are not of
much help or comfort to any particular
sufferer as they depend on the degree
of involvement and the rapidity of
growth. There is, in the vast majority
of cases, no reason why it should ever
reach this stage other than those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
causes which are within the control
of the patient and his doctor.</p>

<p>Lastly we get to a stage in which the
disease is frankly inoperable, and
generally speaking, only capable of
relief by one palliative measure or other.
About forty to fifty per cent. of all cases
which reach the surgeon have already
arrived at this stage, and it is to this
fact that the generally hopeless attitude
of everybody is to be attributed. It is
only when this stage is reached that
the patient has pain and symptoms
which “wake him up,” and that he
realises the calamity which has befallen
him.</p>

<p>The early signs of cancer may now be
summed up as those of a lesion of some
kind, extending over a number of years,
giving rise to very little trouble or
inconvenience, and followed by a small
hard lump or ulcer. If the latter is
present, it is often characterised by
bleeding. Again, practically no
symptoms. To find it we must <em>look and
see</em>; often an operation involving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
practically no suffering and a very
small mortality is necessary. But the
penalties of failure to do this at the
proper time are that ten per cent. of
the population die of cancer.</p>

<p>There are certain popular misconceptions
about cancer which require
correction. The first is that cancer is
necessarily painful. This is responsible
for much of the late diagnosis, operative
mortality and the bad results. Only
late cancer, and it would not be far
wrong to say only <em>incurable</em> cancer,
gives rise to pain. If only pain were an
early sign of cancer the whole aspect
of the cancer problem would be changed.</p>

<p>Another very widespread delusion
productive of great harm is that cancer
is constantly associated with <em>wasting</em>,
and makes <em>rapid progress</em>. These two
symptoms are constantly associated
with the disease in its latest stages but
are not seen at all in early cases.</p>

<p>One frequently hears people say that
cancer is contagious, and also that it
is hereditary. These two popular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
conceptions probably have the same
basis. As we have seen, cancer is a very
common disease, and it would be
strange indeed if, putting all question
of relationship on one side, we were not
to see it quite commonly occurring in
one or more members of the same
family, and if occasionally we did not
find a house in which each successive
occupant for some years had cancer.
I will leave it to the mathematicians to
work out the probability of cancer
occurring more than once in any given
family. The necessary figures are
easily obtained from the Registrar-General’s
office. As far as I know, there
is nothing truly in the nature of what
may be called <em>evidence</em> in support of
either of these notions.</p>

<p>Time after time people have described
parasites of some kind as associated with
cancer, but none of them has yet been
made to answer to any of the tests
necessary to establish anything more
than a casual correlation. It may turn
out to be that the causal agent in cancer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
formation is a parasite either visible
under the microscope, or, what is more
likely, belonging to the group of
ultravisible, or filter-passing, organisms;
but even if this be so, there are two
other factors of immense importance,
found so constantly associated with
the disease, that their significance
cannot be underestimated by anyone
whose outlook is any wider than that
of the mere purveyor of prescriptions.</p>

<p>These two factors may be considered
in a little more detail, as they are of
importance with regard to the question
of prevention. They are (1) the
presence of an acid environment, and
(2) what, for want of a better term, may
be called chronic irritation. Whatever
the prime cause may turn out to be,
these can never be left out of account
in any consideration of aetiology, and
even if some specific cause is found,
the discovery will not shake the
validity of my thesis.</p>

<p>For two thousand years people have
speculated about the origin of cancer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Galen held a theory somewhat analogous
to the present Chinese doctrine of
the <em>yin</em> and the <em>yang</em>; he taught, in
essence, that some kind of “ch’i” had
got at loggerheads with its fellow
gases, and that the result was a general
disturbance of bodily functions. Paracelsus
thought that the salt balance of the
body was upset, and textbooks still
sometimes put this into modern medical
terminology, saying that the balance
of power between different types of
cells is disturbed. This may or may not
<em>describe</em> what happens, but it is a long
way from <em>explaining</em> it.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries cancer was often referred to
as an “act of God” in punishment for
sin. For instance, cancer of the tongue
was said to afflict those who spoke
against the Church, a view that the
Church, not always strictly scientific
in interpretation of phenomena, did
not discourage.</p>

<p>Here is a translation which Sir
D’Arcy Power has made from Paul de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Sorbant, a German physician writing
in 1672, in his <i lang="de">Universa Medicina</i>.
“We saw”; he says, “an ulcer of the
tongue degenerating into cancer in the
noble baron Vertemali, which caused
such a haemorrhage from destruction
of the sublingual arteries and veins
that the patient was suffocated. He
recognised with great penitence that
the cause of this cancer was a divine
punishment because he had often
abused the clergy.” Benetus, about the
same time, in his book called <i lang="la">Medicinae
Septentriniolanus Collatitia</i>, describes
a case of what he calls “Tumor
Linguae Miraculosa.” Here is a translation
of part of it. “There was lately
a certain baron who had a very poisonous
tongue. He not only directed his
jibes against all and sundry, but he
kept his most venemous shafts for the
clergy and those who devoted themselves
to God’s service. He was caught
at last in the very act, by a holy
brother of good repute as he was pealing
this cursed bell, who said to him:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
‘Your foul tongue has overlong
deserved that punishment from an
offended God which it will shortly
receive.’ The Baron went off undismayed,
but a few days afterwards
a small swelling began to grow on the
side of his tongue. Little by little it
increased in size until it became an
inoperable cancer, and at length the
tongue having become incurved,
twisted and drawn back to his throat,
miserably afflicted, but penitent and
confessed, he was summoned before the
Great Judge who calls his servants to
a most strict account.”</p>

<p>This may all seem very far away and
out of contact with our present-day
thought, but only two years ago a
dear old lady sent to the Cancer
Hospital Research Department two
pages of closely written typescript,
the gist of which was that she was
withdrawing her usual annual subscription,
as, after giving the matter a
great deal of thought, she had come to
the conclusion that cancer was caused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
by the consumption of alcohol. So she
proposed to forward her usual subscription
to the local Temperance
Society which really was striking at
the root of the problem! The Secretary
wrote and pointed out that cancer is
very common in cats who are strict
prohibitionists! The old lady did not
reply!</p>

<p>Let us come back again from theory
to fact, and consider some of the
factors which we know constantly to
be associated with cancer, and which
we are justified in regarding as being,
in many cases, more than predisposing
causes.</p>

<p>The most important of these is
chronic irritation. We find that almost
every cancer is preceded for a longer or
shorter period by what may be called
a precancerous condition. The more
our knowledge increases the more we
are finding out that this holds good.</p>

<p>The commonest sites for cancer are
the womb, the breast, and the stomach.
These together account for more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
sixty per cent. of all cancers, and far
below them in frequency we find the
tongue, the lip, and the bowel, and the
various glands.</p>

<p>Cancer of the womb is constantly
preceded for many years by disease,
palpable and curable, often the result
of childbearing, and the part where it
occurs is one bathed in an acid medium.</p>

<p>Cancer of the breast also is constantly
associated with preceding chronic
inflammation, this condition itself producing,
as one of its by-products, a
highly acid substance, further to irritate
the delicate cells already near the end
of their tether. Mechanical irritation,
beyond a doubt, is an important factor.
Although in civilised countries the
disease is distressingly common, in
those countries where the breasts are
habitually uncovered, cancer of this
organ is extremely rare. The habitual
friction of modern clothes predisposes
cell-growth, infection from no matter
what source is given a foothold, and
after years of abuse, the cells lose the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
impulse to normal reaction and at last
turn and slay their victim.</p>

<p>There is evidence that about two-thirds
of all the cases of cancer of the
stomach originate in an old gastric ulcer,
and the constant eating of hot food is
perhaps enough to account for the
remaining third. The delicate gastric
cells, more abused than any other cells
in the body, are bathed in a highly
acid medium. It is no wonder that
departure from their appointed path
accounts for thirty per cent. of all
cancers in men, and in women as well,
if we except the two conditions just
mentioned.</p>

<p>In cancer of the kidney, the bladder,
and the gall bladder, stones are nearly
always present to initiate the irritation.</p>

<p>In cancer of the tongue, syphilitic or
other preceding conditions are nearly
always there, whether it be the irritation
from raw alcohol, hot tobacco
smoke, or a broken tooth. It is interesting
to note that, until syphilis
appeared in Europe, cancer of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
tongue was practically unrecorded in
the existing literature. We have no
need to go any further for examples of
these precancerous irritative conditions.
They are all curable or removable,
but, as they do not as a rule give rise
to acute painful symptoms, severely
inconveniencing the patient, they are
difficult to treat, and the unfortunate
patient is told to <em>wait and see</em>, and is
given medicine which may for a while
relieve, but which—alas!—seldom has
a chance to cure, or to prevent the
fate which is slowly overtaking him.</p>

<p>So far the evidence which has been
brought before you, that chronic irritation
has a causal connection with cancer,
has been of a circumstantial nature:
it has often enough been found in what
we may call suspicious circumstances,
but that does not prove that by itself
it can directly cause the disease. If a
man is seen hanging about the place
where a burglary has been committed,
it does not prove that he participated
in it. He may be a burglar, or he may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
be what lawyers call an accessory
before the fact, and before we can feel
reasonably sure that he is a guilty party
we must, unless we can actually see
him committing the crime, find that
whenever he is present, and he has a
chance, a burglary takes place.</p>

<p>Now in scientific investigation we
can do what in ordinary life is not
possible; we can take our burglar,
arrange a set of suitable circumstances
and see what happens and with what
degree of regularity thefts occur. In
the last four or five years something
like this has been done on a large scale
with cancer, and a large body of
evidence is accumulating which suggests
that, given suitable circumstances,
chronic irritation will produce cancer
with a fair degree of regularity, at
least in some places. If it will do so
in some places there is no reason to
doubt that, under circumstances which
for the moment we do not quite understand,
it will do so in all the places
where cancer is found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>That this is so has not yet been
completely proved, but I think there
is a good deal of evidence along this
line. It has been known for a great
number of years that certain skin
cancers are constantly found in people
whose occupations necessitate their
skin being in contact with certain
chemical irritants. For instance, the
workers in shale oil are often afflicted
with cancer of the skin. In the spinning
industry, when reaching over to deal
with the machinery, a place on the
worker’s leg is always rubbing up
against an oily spindle. This process
goes on for years at the same spot, and
these people are found frequently to
get cancer, beginning at the irritated
place. Some aniline dyes are excreted
in the urine, and growths of the bladder
are very frequent in aniline workers.
In India, some native tribes carry little
metal boxes containing charcoal next
to their skin in order to warm themselves,
and the warmed spot frequently
becomes the seat of a malignant ulcer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Further, in chimney-sweeps, whose skin
is always more or less impregnated with
carbon, we find that cancer frequently
develops in those places where the soot
is difficult to wash completely away
and often is not cleaned off for years at
a time. Finally, we have the well-known
examples of skin cancer among X-ray
workers, and mouth-cancer in those
who chew betel nut.</p>

<p>Now it is just this type of cancer
that we have the opportunity to
imitate in the laboratory. Dr Leitch,
of the Cancer Hospital, has taken rats,
guinea-pigs and rabbits; and, day
after day for months, soot, tar, oils and
all the irritants he could think of were
respectively painted on some selected
part of their bodies. At the Cancer
Hospital he started using tar to paint
on the under surface of the bodies of
white mice. This was done every
morning for several months, and, in
a large percentage of cases, small warts
were produced. The fate of these
warts varied; some of them disappeared,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
but others progressed to the
formation of true cancer. The results
of these experiments made it extremely
probable that the irritants were the
direct cause of the cancer. Of course
it is not <em>proved</em>, for it is possible to
assume that there is some ubiquitous
“other cause”, only waiting till the
tissue resistance is lowered enough by
the irritants to get its chance to act.
Another interesting fact, which transpired
as the result of this work, is that
some of the animals from whom the
warts disappeared developed cancer
a month or so subsequent to the
disappearance, thus showing that the
<em>predisposition</em> to cancer formation is
acquired long before the growth actually
appears.</p>

<p>In human beings, the process of
cancer formation in response to chemical
irritants takes much longer (often
twenty to thirty years), and is preceded
by much the same sort of preliminary
skin reaction as in animals.</p>

<p>In looking for a proximal cause for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
cancer production, we should not,
I think, look for a common cause in
all cases, but should try to find something
or <em>anything</em> which will produce
the necessary previous irritation.</p>

<p>It has not, I think, been established
beyond a doubt that chronic irritation
is the <em>sole</em> exciting cause of cancer—this
in the nature of things would be
very difficult to prove—but it has been
shewn that its presence strongly predisposes
to new growth formation.</p>

<p>The problem which now arises is that
of how we are going to put this knowledge
we have gained to practical use
in the prevention of cancer. In order
to solve this we will consider in some
detail the three commonest cancers
met with, namely cancer of the breast,
the womb and the stomach, and we will
see how the problem applies to them.</p>

<p>Now in cancer of the breast we have
this outstanding fact that, almost all
the cases show for some years beforehand
obvious signs of chronic inflammation
of the breast, and in nearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
all of them this precancerous stage can
be seen, when they are examined
microscopically.</p>

<p>Obviously this is the time to deal
with the disease; and the way to do so
is systematically to examine microscopically
(by a procedure in itself
devoid of all risk, except the very small
one due to the administration of a
general anaesthetic), every <em>doubtfully</em>
malignant breast, afflicted by chronic
inflammation. This may seem a revolutionary
thing to say; but if we set ourselves
to deal with this plague in the
logical manner that we employ when
we sit down to deal with any other pest,
and, if we follow all the facts known
to their inevitable conclusion, we are
driven to it, and we shall see that there
is no other course open to us but to
<em>deal in a wholesale manner with the
precancerous condition</em>. To do this we
shall have to undertake a long campaign
of education. One of the leading
authorities on breast cancer in America,
did undertake such a campaign in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
own district, with the result that, from
the enthusiastic propaganda of one
man, the proportion of precancerous
to fully developed malignant lesions
which appeared at his clinic rose in
six years by thirteen per cent. In
twenty years the proportion of fully
developed cancer to pre-malignant
lesions dropped from ninety to seventy-eight
per cent.</p>

<p>I am quite sure of the fact that the
adoption of this proposal would mean
operations upon a number of breasts
which would never become cancerous,
but, so far as I can see, we cannot help
this, any more than we can help
vaccinating a large number of people
who will never have small-pox, or,
when we isolate diphtheria contacts,
can we help disturbing also a large
number of people who will never get
diphtheria. The public have been
educated to regard these precautions
as natural and proper, and as a rule
raise no objections to their being carried
out. Dr Bloodgood, to whose educational<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
work I have just referred, states
that if any woman could be kept
under sufficiently close observation,
she could be practically assured against
death from cancer. I think every
other surgeon of experience would
agree with him.</p>

<p>So much for prevention and the
precancerous lesions. Let us come to
the question of the cure. Here we find
that the chances of cure in any particular
case simply depend on the stage at
which the case appears for treatment.
We can for convenience divide cases into
two groups; those which have glands
involved and those which have not.
By this I mean those which have
glands so grossly involved that they are
appreciable to the touch. Again
quoting Dr Bloodgood, it is found that
of those cases with gland involvement,
twenty-three per cent. only are cured
after seven years but, of those without
gland involvement, sixty-five per cent.</p>

<p>Now, here is the fact which ought to
rouse us to action: the average duration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
of the disease in these cured cases
was nine months—<em>nine precious months</em>
in which that remaining thirty, or forty,
per cent. might have been cured <em>if they
had only been treated earlier</em>. Or, if
they had been properly examined still
earlier by a trained person, the disease
could have been dealt with earlier with
a still better chance of ultimate cure,
and it is Dr C. H. Mayo who has said
that there is no reason on earth why
about ninety-five per cent. of all cases
of cancer of the breast cannot be
permanently cured.</p>

<p>So far we have spoken in detail of
cancer of the breast but, when we come
to deal with cancer of the uterus, we
shall find that the facts are almost
exactly analogous, only that the results
of indecision and delay are even more
deplorable. We find that, by the time
they come for treatment, about half
the cases are quite incurable, and those
which are operable are as a rule a great
deal further advanced than those of
cancer of the breast. In spite of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
we find that out of two hundred
consecutive cases no less than forty
per cent. were cured; that is to say,
had no recurrence within seven years.
All the cases which were operated on
had had quite definite symptoms for
six months. In other words, the patient
herself should have come for examination
six months before she did, and if
she had been examined in the course of
a proper routine, the disease could have
been discovered far earlier than was
the case.</p>

<p>Quite recently, a report of a series of
cases has been published by Professor
Faure, a distinguished French gynæcologist,
which so exactly illustrates my
views that perhaps I may be forgiven
for making use of it. Faure cut ninety-six
cases of cancer of the uterus and has
divided them into good cases, mediocre
cases and bad cases. It is significant
that there were only twenty-one “good”
cases, thirty-five “mediocre” cases
and forty “bad” cases. The good
cases are what I have called early cases,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the mediocre cases correspond to
moderately advanced cancer, and the
bad cases to those which are on the
border line between operability and
non-operability. His total results
approximate very nearly to most other
published lists but their analysis is very
significant. Of the good cases there
was one operative death; of the
remainder seventy-five per cent. were
cured and twenty-five per cent. recurred.</p>

<p>Of the mediocre cases there was an
operative mortality of 8.57%. Of those
surviving the operation 62.5% were
cured and 37.5% recurred. In the bad
cases there was a post-operative
mortality of 22.5%: only six were cured
and twenty-five recurred. That is to
say, respectively, 19.35% were cured
and 80.65% recurred. These figures
tell their own tale.</p>

<p>With this hopeless condition of affairs
it is no use saying that the results of
surgery are bad. They are; but it is
not the fault of doctors, or the methods
at their disposal; it is the misfortune<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
of the patient that her lack of proper
education must bear the blame.</p>

<p>Cancer of the uterus is in many
cases preceded by precancerous lesions,
all amenable to various kinds of treatment.
Again, the only way to deal
with it is not to wait and see whether
a woman has got cancer but to look
and see that she has not. Until this is
our attitude, the results are not likely
to be much better, whatever the means
at our disposal for its cure.</p>

<p>Finally, turning to another great
group of cancers which make up thirty
per cent. of all in men (and in women
too, if we exclude the two previously
mentioned types), we find exactly the
same condition of affairs.</p>

<p>In two out of every three cases of
cancer of the stomach there is evidence
that it has arisen in an old ulcer, and
Dr Mayo has suggested that eating hot
food may account for the remaining
third. It is moreover the experience of
all surgeons who systematically submit
all gastric ulcers upon which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
operate to microscopic examination,
that about twenty per cent. of them all
are malignant.</p>

<p>We have before us the plain fact that
from ten to twenty per cent. of all
chronic ulcers which have come for
surgical treatment are already malignant
and can only be cured by a complete
removal. Another fact also requires
taking into the most serious
consideration, and this is, that it is the
considered opinion of by far the large
majority of experienced surgeons that
exploration and some form of operation
is the best treatment for every case of
chronic gastric ulcer which has recurred
once, or at least twice, after a thorough
course of medical treatment. (The
term “chronic gastric ulcer” is here
used in its strictest scientific sense, and
by it is meant an ulcer whose diameter
in any one direction is more than a
centimeter, and whose edges are hard
and thickened). In spite of this, a
distinguished surgeon recently put on
record that every case of gastric ulcer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
upon which he operated had on an
average been “cured” nine times. Why
is this? The reason is clear. In nearly
every case the symptoms of gastric
ulcer (and, remember! twenty per cent.
are already cancerous) can be relieved
for a time by palliative treatment, when
once again the deluded patient thinks
he is cured.</p>

<p>There is no need for me to point the
lesson from this. I have put forward
the facts, and every one can draw his
own conclusions. There is only one
gleam of hope that I can see on the
horizon, and that is, in dealing with the
disease in an early stage by radical
measures, and, in twenty per cent.
of the cases, thus combining prevention
with cure.</p>

<p>Again, we must alter our attitude.
We must look and see, not merely
“dope” and see! Once symptoms of
this disease have recurred after efficient
treatment, there is only one good
reason for not looking and making
certain, and that is when the risks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
looking exceed those of the lesion being
malignant—that is to say, somewhere
between ten and twenty per cent. At
present, the risks of looking are about
one in a thousand, and the risks of
removal of a cancer about three per
cent., taking all cases, most of which
are at an advanced stage. The operative
risks of earlier cases are less than this,
and to this must be added about a two
per cent. risk of a further operation
being necessary—in all, not exceeding
five per cent.</p>

<p>I realise that the adoption of this
policy will mean a certain number of
otherwise avoidable operations. I know
that it will mean operating on a few
cases that would otherwise get better
by themselves, or by other means.
But until it is adopted, there is, as far
as I can see, no prospect of reducing
the death-rate from cancer of the
stomach. For so long as indiscriminate
medicine-taking has precedence over
exact methods of investigation and
treatment, so long will cancer of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
stomach continue to make up thirty
per cent. of all cancers. Again the
question is largely out of the hands of
the doctors. As long as patients come
to a doctor wanting “a bottle of
medicine, doctor, just to help me carry
on”, so long will they get it, as the
doctor finds it hard to refuse. For he
knows the patient will go from doctor
to doctor till he gets what he wants.</p>

<p>I have dealt in some detail with the
three commonest types of cancer, but
the same arguments apply to all. The
problem is not so much how to cure
cancer—so much can, and is being
constantly done by one method or
another—but how to educate people so
that we can get hold of cancer early.
The problem is one of diagnosis, and is
therefore to be solved by education and
courage, not by hesitation and fear.</p>

<p>No statement of the cancer problem
would be complete without some mention
of two methods of treatment which
have recently come much to the fore:
namely, the use of X-rays and of radium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>To give any really useful account of
these is very difficult, as no really
satisfactory groups of cases have been
published, and one can only speak from
one’s own experience and that of
colleagues who have been working with
them.</p>

<p>The action of both these methods of
treatment is in essence the same. It
has been found that X-rays and radium
have the power of destroying living
tissue when such is exposed to their
action for varying lengths of time.
Fortunately, cancerous tissue is destroyed
before normal healthy tissue,
and it is the aim of the treatment to
expose the growth to that dosage of
rays which will kill the malignant
tissue but just fall short of doing harm
to the normal tissue. Sometimes this
is more easily done with X-rays and
sometimes with radium; it all depends
on the position of the growth. This
all sounds very attractive, and one
would think that, on the surface of
things, with such a weapon at our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
disposal, every case could easily be
efficiently dealt with. But, like many
other superficially attractive things,
it is found on further examination to
have its drawbacks. Although a proper
dose of X-rays will kill cancer tissue,
a smaller dose will stimulate it to further
action. Further, these rays have,
comparatively speaking, a very low
penetrating power. They are absorbed
and rendered inactive by thin layers of
metal, of skin or of other tissue.</p>

<p>Now, as has already been explained,
a malignant growth, as well as extending
superficially, tends to spread very
deeply and also to involve neighbouring
structures, and when X-rays or radium
are applied to it, we find that in some
cases it will deal with the more superficial
parts of the growth but leave the
deeper parts untouched, or even more
active than before. All kinds of
methods have been tried to get over
this, such as burying radium in the
substance of the growth, and using very
big doses, applied to various aspects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
of the growth, but, so far, although
there have been some very encouraging
results, the problem has not been
solved.</p>

<p>As has been said, it is extremely
difficult to estimate the exact value of
this treatment, as no figures are of any
value till <em>seven years</em> at least have
elapsed after treatment, and no such
figures have been published. There
can be no doubt, however, that an
occasional case has been cured, but it
is the experience of all that the results
of radium treatment do not approximate
in any way to the percentage of
cures obtained by surgery, even in
those types of cancer which react best
to X-rays or radium.</p>

<p>Dr Knox, of the Cancer Hospital,
London, who has had much experience
of high tension X-rays, says that the
treatment of malignant disease by
X-rays has not yet reached that stage
where it ought to be given to any
operable case instead of an operation.
I think this opinion may be regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
an authoritative statement of the
situation as it is at present.</p>

<p>This is not all, however; X-rays and
radium have a very important place
in the treatment of cancer, and as far
as we can see at present, the future
hope lies in a judicious combination of
one or the other of these with surgery,
for early operable cases, and their prolonged
and intensive use in those
advanced cases which cannot be removed
by other means. A few advanced
cases have even been rendered operable
by this means.</p>

<p>In combination with surgery this
method has its very greatest use in the
prevention of superficial recurrences.
In every operation, in spite of the
greatest care, it is impossible to avoid
the setting free into the tissues of a few
cancer cells which may grow later into
a recurrence. Post-operative radiation
bids fair to abolish this type of recurrence,
which formerly accounted for
a good percentage of all recurrences.</p>

<p>From time to time many methods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
have been brought forward which have
for a little while promised well, but so
far none of them has produced results
in any way comparable with those
obtained by complete removal of the
growth by surgical means.</p>

<p>I have not dealt with these in any
detail here because, whether ultimately
we use drugs, surgery, violet leaves or
any of the recently popularised methods
of “taking thought” to cure the
disease, the main point of my thesis
will still hold good, and that is, that by
far the most important factor in the
cure of the disease is that of <em>early
diagnosis</em>. This lies in the hands of the
public far more than in those of the
medical profession. If the public want
early diagnosis they will get it, when
they insist on it, just as they get
anything else they insist on, from self-government
to prohibition, no matter
how good or bad it may be for them.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, most cases of early
cancer are curable, and the diagnosis
of early cancer is only to be made by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
<em>looking</em> instead of <em>waiting</em>. On these
facts, certain constructive proposals
can be based. They are so simple that
they are not likely to be heeded for some
time to come, for the public has always
preferred Abana and Pharpar, rivers
of Damascus, to washing in Jordan,
and I suppose always will do, till we
reach a more enlightened age.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I believe it is true, and
without exaggeration, to say that about
ninety per cent. of all cases could be
cured or prevented if the following
statements were accepted.</p>

<p>If all persons over forty years of age
were routinely examined once every
six months to see that they had not
cancer, or a precancerous condition,
and if these when found were promptly
dealt with, then cancers of the rectum,
tongue, lip, breast, skin and uterus
would cease to be the plagues they
are at present.</p>

<p>Similarly, if every patient who had
taken more than a pound of bismuth
to relieve gastric pain were routinely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
explored to see that cancer or gastric
ulcer did not exist, the large majority
of growths in this region would be
either prevented or cured. Similar
rules can easily be devised to deal with
cancers arising in other parts. What is
wanted is a change of attitude on the
part of everyone concerned. After all,
a fortnight in bed, with forty-eight hours
of discomfort, is not too great a price
to pay for freedom from this disease,
and, with proper examination, even this
would be unnecessary in most cases.</p>

<p>Every intelligent person is aware
that, in order to ensure freedom from
dental disease, it is necessary to have
his teeth examined every six months,
and to have small lesions dealt with in
their very early stages. All have come
to this conclusion because they know
that neglected dental disease means
pain; and they now look to see that
their teeth are normal, instead of
waiting for a toothache to come. It is
true that there are still some of our
weaker brethren who still wait till they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
get toothache before they visit the
dentist; and for them there is nothing
to be done. In the same way, if we
wait for the advanced signs of cancer
to develop, the position with regard to
its cure will remain approximately
what it is to-day.</p>

<p>The education of the public up to
this pitch is by no means an impracticable
proposal. The position
with regard to appendicitis is very much
the same as that of cancer. What has
been done in the case of appendicitis?
The mortality is in proportion to the
number of hours during which the
disease has existed. Twenty years ago
appendicitis was responsible for a large
number of deaths. During 1919 and
1920 there was, in a large London
General Hospital, only one death from
appendicitis, and yet there were at
least 5 cases dealt with every week.
This improvement is entirely the result
of education of the public and their
doctors. They know that to be cured
operation must be early, and so we no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
longer wait to see whether the patient
is going to die; if we suspect it, we look
and see whether it is present or not.
True, we remove unnecessarily a fair
number of appendixes but, by so doing,
we purchase, for a much larger number
of people, immunity from death by
this disease. When exactly the same
principle is applied to cancer we shall
be in a position to be a great deal more
satisfied than we are at present.</p>

<p>One of the most successful ways of
treating a patient with fixed ideas is
by the use of <em>explanation</em> combined with
strong <em>counter-suggestion</em>. This is the
method of psycho-analysis and hypnotism.
No patient is more susceptible
to this kind of treatment than that
capricious lady, Public Opinion. If we
want to realise the ideals put forward
in the early part of this essay, we must
mobilise all our resources: the Press;
the Platform; the Consulting Room:
for a prolonged and intensive campaign
against this black spot on our
civilization.</p>
